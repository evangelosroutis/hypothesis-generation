      Task: Generate Cypher queries to query a graph database containing genes and their potential associations to diseases.
      Instructions:
      Don't assume you will be always be given a gene name in the query. You may be given a gene symbol, so make sure you search in the synonyms properties of the gene in the database.
      Use only the provided relationship types and properties in the schema.
      Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses.
      Do not include any text except from the generated Cypher query. 
      Do not produce the word cypher in front of the query.
      Schema:
      {schema}
      Examples:
      # 'Is gene GNAI1 associated with Parkinson disease?' 
      MATCH (g:Gene)-[:ASSOCIATED_WITH]->(d:Disease)
      WHERE 'GNAI1' IN g.synonyms AND d.name='Parkinson disease'
      RETURN g.names as gene_names, g.synonyms as gene_synonyms, d.name as disease_name,  d.disease_id as KEGG_pathway

      # 'Is gene Alpha-synuclein associated with Parkinson's?'

      Please provide an improved Cypher statement that works. DO NOT add any explanations or apologies! I only need the statement.

    final_prompt: |
      Human: You are an assistant that helps to form nice and human understandable answers.
      You will be provided with information that you must use to construct an answer.
      The provided information is authoritative, you must never doubt it or try to use your internal knowledge to correct it.
      Make the answer sound as a response to the question. 
      Here is an example:
      Question: Is ADORA2 somehow connected with Parkinson disease?
      Information: {{'gene_name':"Adenosine receptor A2a",'gene_synonyms':["ADORA2", "ADORA2A"],'disease_name':"Parkinson disease",'KEGG_pathway':"05012"}}
      Helpful Answer: Yes ADORA2, also known as 'ADORA2A' and 'Adenosine receptor A2a' is associated with Parkinson disease. It appears in pathway 05012 of the KEGG database.

      Human: You are an assistant that helps to form nice and human understandable answers.
      You will be provided with information about two genes and their interaction that you must use to construct an answer.
      The provided information is authoritative, you must never doubt it or try to use your internal knowledge to correct it.
      The information will have form: name(s) of gene 1, name(s) of gene 2 and the description of the interaction in the form (qualifier,name,aspect)
      Make the answer sound as a response to the question. 
      USE ONLY the information provided and NOTHING ELSE, DO NOT make up facts.
      DO NOT ADD any followup questions or answers.
      For example, if you are given a question:
      'Please describe the interaction of ['Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2', 'Heme-binding protein 1'] with ['Thioredoxin', 'Thioredoxin, mitochondrial', 'Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2B'] using the description 
      qualifier: enables
      name: RNA polymerase II-specific DNA-binding transcription factor binding
      definition: Binding to a sequence-specific DNA binding RNA polymerase II transcription factor, any of the factors that interact selectively and non-covalently with a specific DNA sequence in order to modulate transcription.
      aspect: Molecular Function
      start your response by 'Suppressor of cytokine signaling 6' (also known as 'Suppressor of cytokine signaling 7', 'Suppressor of cytokine signaling 4') interacts with Thioredoxin (also known as 'Thioredoxin, mitochondrial', 'Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2B') via ...

      You are given the following ground truth information containing a list of paths of interactions of genes. Each path contains information about each interaction: pay close attention to the start node names, end node names, the type and subtype of the interaction.
      {manual_result}
      The following response contains information about paths and the interactions within each path. 
      {final_response}
      The information in the response will contain information not present in the ground truth. DO NOT assess if the response contains information that is not found in the ground truth.
      INSTEAD, you need to assess if the information in the response makes sense or clashes with the information from the ground truth.
      First, make sure the interactions on either side pertain to the same genes by checking their names. Next, check the subtype and type on the ground truth side such as activation/inhibition/phosphorylation etc and the names of the genes in the interaction. 
      Does the description fit in the context of the type of interaction in the ground truth? Give a SHORT overall assessment NO MORE than 100 words and a SCORE for alignment.
